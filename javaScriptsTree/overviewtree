A tree in JavaScript is a non-linear hierarchical data structure used to store data in the form of nodes connected by edges. Unlike arrays or linked lists, a tree represents relationships where one node acts as the root and other nodes branch out as children, forming parent-child relationships. Each node in a tree contains data and references to its child nodes, and there is always a single root node at the top. Trees are widely used in JavaScript for representing structured data such as the HTML DOM, file systems, organizational hierarchies, and search structures. Common types of trees include binary trees, where each node has at most two children; binary search trees, which maintain sorted order for fast searching and insertion; heaps used in priority queues; and trie trees used for efficient string searching. Tree traversal methods like preorder, inorder, postorder, and level order are used to access or process nodes. Overall, trees play a crucial role in data structures and algorithms because they provide efficient searching, sorting, and hierarchical data management in JavaScript applications.
