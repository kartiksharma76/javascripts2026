Sorting in JavaScript means arranging data in a specific order such as ascending or
descending. It is mainly used to organize arrays of numbers, strings, or objects. 
JavaScript provides a built-in method called sort() which is used to sort elements 
of an array. By default, this method sorts elements alphabetically as strings, so
for numeric sorting a compare function is required. Sorting helps in efficient 
searching, data analysis, and better presentation of information. There are different
sorting algorithms used in JavaScript such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, 
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. These algorithms differ
in performance and time complexity, where simple sorts like bubble and selection 
take O(n²) time, while advanced sorts like merge and quick sort take O(n log n) time.
Sorting is an important concept in JavaScript and Data Structures because it improves 
efficiency and organization of data in programs.
